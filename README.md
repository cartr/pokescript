PokéScript lets you learn code by playing Pokémon Red Version.  It's like those Hour of Code "guide the character down the path" puzzles, only cooler.  You can also cheat and give yourself Ꝑ99999, see your opponents' Pokémon's stats, and change your name!

## Features

- Make the computer press buttons for you!
- [API bindings](https://github.com/cartr/pokescript/wiki/Pok%C3%A9Script-Documentation) to game features (push buttons, read signs, check Pokémon stats)
- Full interactive tutorial (learn how to write loops and functions!)
- Entirely client-side JavaScript
